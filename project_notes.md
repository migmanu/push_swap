# PUSH_SWAP NOTES

## ToDo
[x] Decide if the use of dedicated function for the operations is needed:
    Probably it would be better to implement general functions that work
    for any stack and manage the writing to console from outside.
- Check mvs_to_top file:
    Check if functions are still needed. Rotate and rev_rotate might replace
    dedicated operation functions.
